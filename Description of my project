This C++ program calculates and displays the frequency of each word in a given string. It uses a map to store the words as keys and their corresponding counts as values. The program processes the input string, counts the occurrences of each word, and outputs the results in a readable format. It effectively handles spaces to separate words and counts the last word after the loop. This code is a useful example of basic string manipulation and data structure usage in C++.
